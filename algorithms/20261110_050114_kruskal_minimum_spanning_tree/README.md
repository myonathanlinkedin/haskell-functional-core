# Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree with Disjoint-Set Union in Haskell

Core **Haskell** implementation for **Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree with Disjoint-Set Union**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Balanced Hierarchical Indexing`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Node Pointers & Self-Balancing Trees`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(log N)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
runghc main.hs
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Kruskal Minimum Spanning Tree with Disjoint-Set Union` in `Haskell`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
