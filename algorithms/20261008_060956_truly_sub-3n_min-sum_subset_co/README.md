# Truly Sub-3ⁿ Min-Sum Subset Convolution and Join Ordering

An in-memory reference implementation of **Truly Sub-3ⁿ Min-Sum Subset Convolution and Join Ordering** in **Haskell**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

### Core Highlights
* **Language & Standard**: Modern `Haskell` standard library conventions.
* **Architecture Pattern**: Designed for `Algorithmic Engineering` using `Standard Memory Primitives`.
* **Runtime Overhead**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Concurrency & Safety**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

### Complexity Analysis

| Dimension | Bound |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Time (Best Case)** | `O(1)` |
| **Time (Worst Case)** | `O(N log N)` |
| **Auxiliary Space** | `O(N)` |

### Test Suite Execution

Self-contained verification drivers are embedded directly in `main.hs` to validate happy paths, boundary inputs, and invariant preservation.

```bash
runghc main.hs
```
