# Safe Optimistic Lock Coupling in Haskell

Core **Haskell** implementation for **Safe Optimistic Lock Coupling**, structured for computational clarity, explicit data structures, and deterministic unit test coverage.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Low-Latency Systems & Memory Layout`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Contiguous Memory Buffer & Ring Pointers`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Memory allocations are kept minimal to maintain clear data locality and predictable memory bounds.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(1)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N) bounded` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
runghc main.hs
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Safe Optimistic Lock Coupling` in `Haskell`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
